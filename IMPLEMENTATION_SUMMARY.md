---

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fix (Post-Implementation)

**Issue Discovered:** Google Drive upload nodes were missing the `binaryData: true` parameter

**Impact:** Without this parameter, the upload nodes would fail to find the file data prepared by the packager nodes, causing all document uploads to fail.

**Files Fixed:**
- `workflows/titan-main-workflow.json`

**Nodes Updated:**
1. Vision Document Uploader (`save-vision`) - Added `binaryData: true`
2. Vision Paper Trail Uploader (`upload-vision-paper-trail`) - Added `binaryData: true`
3. Architecture Document Uploader (`save-architecture`) - Added `binaryData: true`
4. Architecture Paper Trail Uploader (`upload-arch-paper-trail`) - Added `binaryData: true`

**Technical Details:**
- n8n's Google Drive node requires explicit `binaryData: true` to use binary file data from previous nodes
- The packager nodes correctly create binary data in the `binary.file` field
- Without `binaryData: true`, the upload nodes don't know to look for this binary data
- This parameter instructs n8n to use the binary attachment instead of trying to read a file from disk

**Status:** ✅ Fixed (2026-01-13)

- **Updated connection:** Vision Context Retrieval → Market Research Engine (direct)
  - Previously: Vision Context Retrieval → API Rate Limiter → Market Research Engine

**Performance Impact:**
- **Saves 1 second per workflow execution** (~5% of total time)

#### 4. ✅ Wait Node Timeouts (critical reliability fix)
**File Modified:** `workflows/titan-main-workflow.json`

**Changes:**
