# Titan Workflow Suite - Claude Integration Guide

## Overview

The **Titan Workflow Suite** is a sophisticated n8n-based AI orchestration system that automatically generates comprehensive **Product Vision** and **Architecture** documents through multi-phase, collaborative AI agent workflows.

### What It Does

This system uses specialized AI agents working together to:
- Extract technical standards and decisions from existing documentation
- Create detailed Product Vision documents through iterative refinement
- Generate Architecture Vision documents with technical depth
- Validate and audit output quality through adversarial review
- Maintain knowledge graphs and vector embeddings for context retention

### Key Capabilities

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: 5 specialized AI agents (Scavenger, Creator, Critic, Refiner, Auditor)
- **Iterative Refinement**: Adversarial loops that improve output quality through multiple iterations
- **Knowledge Management**: Integration with Graphiti (knowledge graph) and Qdrant (vector database)
- **Document Intelligence**: Automatic extraction from Google Drive documents
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and scoring mechanisms
- **Cost Optimization**: Smart model selection (GPT-4 for reasoning, GPT-4o-mini for extraction)

### Version

Current version: **v2.3.0** (2026-01-13)

### Workflow Phases

#### Phase 0: Scavenger (2-5 minutes)
- Scans Google Drive folder for technical documents
- Extracts technical standards, patterns, and decisions
- Stores findings in Graphiti knowledge graph
- Generates embeddings and stores in Qdrant vector database

#### Phase 1: Vision Loop (5-15 minutes)
- **Creator** generates initial Product Vision document
- **Critic** evaluates and scores the draft (0-10)
- **Refiner** improves the document based on feedback
- Iterates up to 5 times or until score ≥ 9.0
- Maintains full iteration history

#### Phase 2: Architecture Loop (5-15 minutes)
- Same adversarial loop pattern as Phase 1
- Focuses on Architecture Vision document
- Leverages knowledge from Phase 1
- Uses Graphiti context for technical consistency

#### Phase 3: Audit (1-3 minutes)
- **Auditor** validates combined documentation
- Checks compliance with extracted standards
- Verifies technical accuracy
- Provides final quality score

**Total Duration**: 15-40 minutes per complete run

```

> **Note**: Replace `${VARIABLE_NAME}` placeholders with your actual API keys. Store these in your `.mcp.json` file (which is gitignored) or use environment variables.

### Activation Steps

#### Option 1: Using Claude CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Add n8n MCP server to user scope (available in all projects)
claude mcp add

# Or add to project scope (only this project)
claude mcp add --scope project
```

Then provide these details when prompted:
- **Server name**: `n8n-mcp`
- **Command**: `npx`
- **Args**: `-y supergateway --streamableHttp https://c3po.etrox.de/mcp-server/http --header "authorization:Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"`

#### Option 2: Manual Configuration

**For Project Scope** (recommended for this repository):

1. **Create `.mcp.json` in project root**:
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell (from project root)
   cd C:\Users\180-1\Documents\workspace\curosr-n8n
   notepad .mcp.json
   ```

2. **Paste the configuration** (shown above in MCP Configuration section)

3. **Save the file**

   **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The `.mcp.json` file contains sensitive API keys. A `.gitignore` file has been created to exclude it from version control. Do NOT commit this file to git.

**For User Scope** (available in all projects):

1. **Create/Edit `~/.claude.json`**:
   ```powershell
   # Windows PowerShell
   notepad $env:USERPROFILE\.claude.json
   ```

2. **Add the `mcpServers` section** to your existing config, or create new file with the configuration shown above

3. **Save and close** the file

**After Configuration**:

4. **Restart Claude Code** completely (close all sessions)

5. **Verify Connection**:
   - Start a new conversation with Claude
   - Ask: "What n8n workflows are available?"
   - Claude should list the Titan workflows

### Verification

To test the MCP connection is working:

```powershell
# Test n8n instance accessibility
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://c3po.etrox.de" -Method GET

# Test MCP endpoint (should return workflow list)
# Replace $env:N8N_API_KEY with your actual n8n API token
$headers = @{
    "authorization" = "Bearer $env:N8N_API_KEY"
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
}
$body = '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://c3po.etrox.de/mcp-server/http" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body
```

## Using Titan with Claude

### Basic Usage

Once MCP is configured, you can interact with Titan workflows naturally through conversation:

#### Example 1: Full Document Generation

```
You: "I need to generate product and architecture documentation for my new
e-commerce platform. The source documents are in Google Drive folder
1abc123def456. The project is called 'ShopFast'."

Claude: [Executes titan-main-workflow with appropriate parameters]
[Returns complete Vision and Architecture documents after 20-30 minutes]
```

#### Example 2: Quick Vision Document

```
You: "Create just a Product Vision document for a mobile fitness app.
Use the standards we've already extracted."

Claude: [Executes titan-adversarial-loop-subworkflow for vision document]
[Returns refined vision document after 5-10 minutes]
```

#### Example 3: Search Technical Standards

```
You: "What authentication patterns are stored in our knowledge graph?"

Claude: [Executes titan-graphiti-subworkflow with search_facts operation]
[Returns relevant authentication patterns and decisions]
```

### Advanced Usage Patterns

#### Monitoring Long-Running Workflows

```
You: "Start the full Titan workflow for project 'Alpha'. Let me know
when each phase completes."

Claude: [Starts workflow and provides status updates]
- Phase 0: Scavenger completed (3 minutes)
- Phase 1: Vision Loop completed (8 minutes, 3 iterations, score 9.2)
- Phase 2: Architecture Loop in progress...
```

#### Querying Context During Execution

```
You: "While that runs, what technical standards did the Scavenger find?"

Claude: [Queries Graphiti for extracted standards while main workflow continues]
```

#### Custom Parameters

```
You: "Run Titan for project 'Beta' using Google Drive folder 1xyz789abc
with focus on microservices architecture and event-driven patterns."

Claude: [Includes your architectural preferences in the workflow input]
```

### Best Practices

1. **Provide Clear Project Context**: The more detail you give about your project, the better the output quality
2. **Use Descriptive Project IDs**: Makes it easier to track and reference later
3. **Verify Google Drive Access**: Ensure the n8n Google Drive credential has access to your folder
4. **Monitor Costs**: Each full run costs $1.50-$3.00 in OpenAI API usage
5. **Review Intermediate Outputs**: Check Scavenger results before continuing to ensure accurate standard extraction
6. **Iterate on Results**: Use the Adversarial Loop directly to refine specific sections

### Combining MCP Capabilities

You can leverage multiple MCP servers together for enhanced workflows:

**Enhanced Document Generation**:
```
You: "Use Exa to research best practices for microservices architecture,
then use that research as context for generating an Architecture Vision
document using the Titan workflow for project 'MicroserviceApp'."
```

**Security-Enhanced Workflow**:
```
You: "After generating the architecture document, use Semgrep to scan
the codebase for security vulnerabilities and include findings in the
technical standards."
```

**Web Research Integration**:
```
You: "Use Firecrawl to extract technical documentation from [company website],
store it in the Titan knowledge graph, then generate architecture docs
that align with their standards."
```

**Automated Testing Integration**:
```
You: "Generate the product vision using Titan, then use Playwright to
create automated UI tests based on the documented user flows."
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Connection Issues

#### Problem: "n8n-mcp server not responding"

**Symptoms**: Claude says it can't connect to n8n or workflows aren't visible

**Solutions**:
1. Verify n8n instance is accessible:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://c3po.etrox.de" -Method GET
   ```

2. Check MCP is enabled in n8n:
   - Login to n8n at https://c3po.etrox.de
   - Go to Settings → Instance-level MCP
   - Ensure "Enable MCP access" is toggled ON

3. Verify token hasn't expired:
   - Generate a new MCP Access Token in n8n settings
   - Update the token in your `.mcp.json` (project) or `~/.claude.json` (user) file
   - Restart Claude Code

4. Check firewall/network:
   - Ensure your firewall allows outbound HTTPS to c3po.etrox.de
   - Try from a different network if corporate firewall is blocking

#### Problem: "Workflow not found" or "No workflows available"

**Solutions**:
1. Mark workflows as "Available in MCP":
   - Open each Titan workflow in n8n
   - Enable the "Available in MCP" toggle
   - Save the workflow

2. Ensure workflows have compatible triggers:
   - Titan workflows use Chat Triggers (supported by MCP)
   - Webhook and Schedule triggers are also supported

3. Restart the MCP server:
   - Restart Claude Code completely (close all sessions)
   - Wait 10-15 seconds for MCP initialization

### Workflow Execution Errors

#### Problem: "Credential not found: OpenAI API"

**Solution**: Create credentials with exact names:
- `OpenAI API` for AI Agent nodes
- `OpenAI API Header` for Qdrant embedding generation
- Names must match exactly (case-sensitive)

#### Problem: "Validation Error: Missing Google Drive folder ID"

**Solution**: Ensure your input includes the `drive_folder_id`:
```json
{
  "project_id": "myproject",
  "drive_folder_id": "1abc123def456",
  "description": "My project description"
}
```

#### Problem: "Graphiti connection refused"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Graphiti is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://graphiti:8000/health
   # or
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

2. Check `GRAPHITI_URL` environment variable in n8n

3. Ensure n8n can reach Graphiti:
   - If using Docker, both containers must be on same network
   - If using external Graphiti, ensure network connectivity

#### Problem: "Qdrant authentication failed"

**Solutions**:
1. If Qdrant has authentication enabled:
   - Set `QDRANT_API_KEY` environment variable in n8n
   - Qdrant workflow uses `api-key` header (not Authorization)

2. If Qdrant doesn't have auth:
   - Remove or leave empty the `QDRANT_API_KEY` variable
   - Workflow will work without authentication

#### Problem: "Embedding generation failed"

**Solution**:
1. Verify `OpenAI API Header` credential is configured:
   - Header Name: `Authorization`
   - Header Value: `Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY`

2. Check OpenAI API key has sufficient credits

3. Verify API key has access to `text-embedding-3-small` model

#### Problem: "Subworkflow returns no data"

**Solution**: This was fixed in v2.2.0. Ensure you're using the latest workflows:
- All subworkflows now have proper `Merge Output` nodes
- Re-import workflow files if you have older versions
- Verify all subworkflows are marked "Active"

### Performance Issues

#### Problem: Workflow takes longer than expected (>45 minutes)

**Possible Causes**:
1. **High OpenAI API latency**: Check OpenAI status page
2. **Many iterations in adversarial loop**: Critic is giving low scores
3. **Large document corpus**: Scavenger processing many files
4. **Network latency**: Slow connection to Graphiti/Qdrant

**Solutions**:
- Monitor iteration counts in workflow execution logs
- Reduce max iterations in adversarial loop (default: 5)
- Use faster models (GPT-4o-mini) for non-critical agents
- Optimize document corpus (remove unnecessary files)

#### Problem: High OpenAI API costs

**Solutions**:
1. **Use GPT-4o-mini for all agents**: ~95% cost reduction
   - Edit each agent node to use `gpt-4o-mini` model
   - Accept slightly lower quality output

2. **Reduce iteration limits**:
   - Lower max iterations from 5 to 3 in adversarial loop
   - Increase quality threshold from 9.0 to 8.5

3. **Batch multiple projects**:
   - Process multiple related projects together
   - Reuse knowledge graph context

4. **Monitor token usage**:
   - Check workflow telemetry for token counts
   - Reduce prompt sizes if needed

### Configuration Validation

Run this validation checklist:

```markdown
✅ n8n instance accessible at https://c3po.etrox.de
✅ MCP enabled in n8n settings

## AI Product Factory - Human-in-the-Loop Workflow

The **AI Product Factory** is an advanced workflow system that builds on Titan's patterns to provide a fully human-in-the-loop product development lifecycle. It features multi-model agent routing, state-aware resumability, and strict tech governance.

### Key Differences from Titan

| Feature | Titan | AI Product Factory |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **Model Routing** | Single provider (OpenRouter) | Multi-model via OpenRouter (Claude + GPT-4o + Perplexity) |
| **Human Interaction** | Checkpoints only | Full governance approval for tech standards |
| **Resumability** | Manual | Automatic state persistence with Smart Start |
| **Research** | None | Perplexity Sonar for fact-checking and risk research |
| **Score Threshold** | 0-10 scale | 0-100 scale (more granular) |

     Is this a Global Standard (all projects) or Local Standard (this project only)?"

User: POST to webhook with { "scope": "global" }

AI: [Stores in Graphiti global_standards group]
    [Stores in Qdrant with scope: global]
    [Logs decision]
    [Continues to next standard]
```

#### Resuming a Project

```
User: "Resume"

AI: "Found existing project: **ShopFast**

     Current Status:
     - Phase: 1 - Product Vision Loop
     - Status: in_progress
     - Last Score: 78/100

     Would you like to:
     1. Resume from Phase 1
     2. Start over

### Modifying Workflows

#### Editing Agent Behavior

To customize agent prompts:

1. **Read the current prompts**: See `workflows/TITAN_AGENT_PROMPTS.md`
2. **Edit in n8n**:
   - Open the workflow containing the agent
   - Find the "AI Agent" node for that agent
   - Modify the "System Message" field
   - Save and test
3. **Document changes**: Update `TITAN_AGENT_PROMPTS.md` with your changes

#### Adding New Agents

1. **Create AI Agent node** in n8n
2. **Configure model**:
   - Choose appropriate model (GPT-4, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Opus)
   - Set temperature (0.2 for analytical, 0.7 for creative)
3. **Add memory** (if needed):
   - Window Buffer Memory for conversation context
   - Simple Memory for stateless operations
4. **Attach tools** (optional):
   - Connect Graphiti subworkflow as a tool
   - Connect Qdrant subworkflow as a tool
5. **Test independently** before integrating

#### Modifying Workflow Logic

Common modifications:

**Change iteration limits**:
- Edit "Increment Iteration" node in adversarial loop
- Modify the `maxIterations` variable (default: 5)

**Adjust quality thresholds**:
- Edit "Check Score" node in adversarial loop
- Modify the score comparison (default: ≥ 9.0)

**Add checkpoints**:
- Insert Wait nodes for user confirmation
- Useful for reviewing intermediate outputs

**Change model selection**:
- Edit "Chat Model" nodes in each agent
- Switch between GPT-4, GPT-4o-mini, or Claude Opus

## Security Considerations

### MCP Token Security

**API Keys in MCP Configuration**:

The MCP configuration includes several API keys that provide access to external services:

| Service | Key Type | Access Level | Security Priority |
|---------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **n8n** | JWT Token | Full API access to workflows | 🔴 Critical |
| **Firecrawl** | API Key | Web scraping credits | 🟡 Medium |
| **Exa** | API Key | Search API usage | 🟡 Medium |
| **Perplexity** | API Key | AI search credits | 🟡 Medium |
| **Ref** | API Key | Documentation access | 🟢 Low |

**Security Best Practices**:

- **Do not commit** `.mcp.json` with tokens to version control (add to `.gitignore`)
- **Rotate tokens regularly** (recommended: every 90 days)
- **Use environment-specific tokens** for development vs production
- **Revoke immediately** if any token is compromised
- **Prefer user-scoped config** (`~/.claude.json`) to keep tokens out of repositories
- **Monitor API usage** for all services to detect unauthorized access
- **Set billing alerts** on services that charge per usage (Firecrawl, Exa, Perplexity)

### API Key Management

- Store OpenAI API keys in n8n credentials (encrypted at rest)
- Use separate API keys for different environments
- Monitor API usage in OpenAI dashboard
- Set up billing alerts to prevent unexpected charges

### Data Privacy

- Documents processed by Titan are sent to OpenAI API
- Embeddings are stored in Qdrant (ensure proper access controls)
- Knowledge graph data in Graphiti (ensure proper access controls)
- Google Drive documents require appropriate OAuth scopes

### Best Practices

1. **Least Privilege**: Only grant necessary permissions to service accounts
2. **Audit Logs**: Review n8n execution logs regularly
3. **Secure Communications**: Always use HTTPS for n8n instance
4. **Input Validation**: Titan workflows validate inputs, but verify source data
5. **Output Sanitization**: Review generated documents before sharing externally
